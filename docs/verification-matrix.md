# Verification Matrix

This matrix records local commands, CI equivalents, status, and first decisive
failures for each completed Engram slice.

## 2026-06-25: Upstream Parity Audit Docs

Branch: `docs/parity-01-upstream-audit`

Scope:

- `docs/parity/claude-mem-parity-map.md`
- `docs/reference-gates.md`

| Check | Local command | CI job | Required | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| live repo state | `git status --short --branch` | none yet | yes | pass | Shows intended new docs plus pre-existing `.gitignore` change. |
| whitespace | `git diff --check` | none yet | yes | pass | Exit 0. |
| placeholder scan | `rg -n "[T]BD|[T]ODO|[F]IXME|[P]LACEHOLDER" docs/parity docs/reference-gates.md docs/verification-matrix.md` | none yet | yes | pass | Exit 1 with no matches. |
| docs content review | `sed -n '1,980p' docs/parity/claude-mem-parity-map.md`, `sed -n '1,700p' docs/reference-gates.md`, and `sed -n '1,200p' docs/verification-matrix.md` | none yet | yes | pass | Manual review completed against `goal.md` parity-map requirements. |

CI is not yet implemented on `master` for Engram's new architecture branch.
The monorepo/backend scaffold slice must replace `none yet` with required CI
jobs before code-bearing work is merged.
